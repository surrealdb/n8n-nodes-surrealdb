## Installation

### Prerequisites

1. You need a self-hosted n8n instance (v0.214.0 or later recommended)
2. You need access to a SurrealDB instance (v1.0.0 or later recommended)

### Installation Steps

1. Open your n8n instance
2. Go to **Settings** > **Community Nodes**
3. Click **Install**
4. Enter `@surrealdb/n8n-nodes-surrealdb` and click **Install**
5. Restart your n8n instance if prompted

## Configuration

### Credentials

To use the SurrealDB node, you need to create credentials with the following properties:

* **Connection String** - The connection string to your SurrealDB instance (must start with `http://` or `https://`). WebSocket connections (`ws://` or `wss://`) are not supported.
* **Authentication** - Choose the authentication scope:
  * **Root** - Full access to all namespaces and databases
  * **Namespace** - Access limited to a specific namespace
  * **Database** - Access limited to a specific database within a namespace
* **Username** - Username for authentication
* **Password** - Password for authentication
* **Namespace** - Target namespace (required for Namespace and Database authentication)
* **Database** - Target database (required for Database authentication)

#### Authentication Types and Namespace/Database Handling

The authentication type you choose affects how namespace and database information is handled:

1. **Root Authentication**:
   * Provides access to all namespaces and databases
   * Namespace and Database fields in credentials are optional
   * You can override namespace/database at the node level for each operation

2. **Namespace Authentication**:
   * Provides access to all databases within a specific namespace
   * Namespace field in credentials is required
   * Database field in credentials is optional
   * You can override the database at the node level for each operation

3. **Database Authentication**:
   * Provides access to a specific database within a specific namespace
   * Both Namespace and Database fields in credentials are required
   * You can still override these at the node level for specific operations

#### Node-Level Namespace and Database Overrides

For most operations, you can override the namespace and database settings from your credentials:

1. In the node configuration, expand the **Options** section
2. Enter values in the **Namespace** and/or **Database** fields
3. These values will take precedence over the credential settings for that specific operation
4. You will be required to provide a namespace when using Namespace authentication
5. You will be required to provide both a namespace and database when using Database authentication

## Operations

The SurrealDB node provides a fairly comprehensive set of operations organized by resource type. For most anything not covered, you can use the Execute Query operation.

### Record Operations

## Understanding SurrealDB and n8n Integration

### Connection Protocol

**Important**: Due to n8n's architecture, this node only supports HTTP/HTTPS connections to SurrealDB. WebSocket connections (WS/WSS) are not supported.

- Your connection string must start with `http://` or `https://` (not `ws://` or `wss://`)
- When configuring your SurrealDB instance, ensure it's accessible via HTTP/HTTPS
- If you're using SurrealDB Cloud or another instance that only offers WebSocket connections, you'll need to set up a self-hosted SurrealDB instance with HTTP enabled
- This limitation is due to how n8n handles connections and executes node operations

### Connection Pooling

The SurrealDB node includes comprehensive connection pooling to improve performance and resource management. Connection pooling allows the node to reuse database connections across multiple operations, reducing connection overhead and improving response times.

#### Pool Configuration Options

You can configure the connection pool through the "Connection Pooling" options in any node operation:

- **Max Connections** (default: 10): Maximum number of connections in the pool
- **Min Connections** (default: 2): Minimum number of connections to keep in the pool
- **Acquire Timeout** (default: 30000ms): Maximum time to wait for a connection from the pool
- **Health Check Interval** (default: 60000ms): Interval between health checks for pool connections
- **Max Idle Time** (default: 300000ms): Maximum time a connection can remain idle before being closed
- **Retry Attempts** (default: 3): Number of retry attempts for failed connection acquisitions
- **Retry Delay** (default: 1000ms): Delay between retry attempts

#### Pool Monitoring

Use the **System > Get Pool Statistics** operation to monitor pool performance:

```json
{
  "poolStatistics": {
    "totalConnections": 5,
    "activeConnections": 2,
    "idleConnections": 3,
    "waitingRequests": 0,
    "totalRequests": 150,
    "failedRequests": 2,
    "averageResponseTime": 45,
    "successRate": 99
  },
  "performance": {
    "averageResponseTimeMs": 45,
    "requestsPerSecond": 2,
    "errorRate": 1
  },
  "poolHealth": {
    "utilizationRate": 40,
    "availableConnections": 3,
    "waitingRequests": 0
  }
}
```

#### Benefits of Connection Pooling

- **Improved Performance**: Reuses connections instead of creating new ones for each operation
- **Resource Management**: Limits the number of concurrent connections to prevent database overload
- **Automatic Health Checks**: Monitors connection health and removes unhealthy connections
- **Connection Recovery**: Automatically retries failed connection acquisitions
- **Idle Connection Cleanup**: Removes unused connections to free up resources

#### Pool Lifecycle

- **Initialization**: Pool is created when the first operation is executed
- **Connection Acquisition**: Operations get connections from the pool or create new ones if needed
- **Connection Release**: Connections are returned to the pool after each operation
- **Health Monitoring**: Regular health checks ensure connections remain valid
- **Cleanup**: Pool is automatically closed when the node is deactivated

#### SurrealDB HTTP vs WebSocket

SurrealDB supports both HTTP and WebSocket protocols:

- **HTTP/HTTPS**: Used for stateless connections, ideal for individual queries
- **WebSocket (WS/WSS)**: Used for stateful connections, better for real-time applications

This node uses the HTTP/HTTPS protocol exclusively, which means:

1. Each operation creates a new connection to SurrealDB
2. The connection is closed after the operation completes
3. No persistent connection is maintained between operations

### SurrealDB Result Handling

SurrealDB operations often return empty results rather than errors when no matching data is found. This behavior differs from many other databases and can be important to understand when building workflows:

- **Empty Results vs. Errors**: A query for a non-existent record returns an empty result, not an error
- **Always Output Data**: The "Always Output Data" option is particularly useful with SurrealDB to ensure your workflow continues even when no results are found

### Working with SurrealDB Data Types

SurrealDB supports rich data types that map well to n8n's JSON handling:

- **Records and IDs**: SurrealDB record IDs use the format `table:id`
- **Relationships**: Relationships are first-class citizens in SurrealDB
- **Arrays and Objects**: Nested data structures are fully supported

## Error Handling

The SurrealDB node includes a comprehensive error handling and recovery system that automatically manages common database issues:

### Automatic Error Classification

The system automatically categorizes errors into different types:
- **Connection Errors**: Network issues, timeouts, connection refused
- **Authentication Errors**: Invalid credentials, unauthorized access
- **Query Errors**: Syntax errors, malformed queries
- **Validation Errors**: Invalid data, missing required fields
- **System Errors**: Database server issues, internal errors

### Intelligent Retry Logic

- **Exponential Backoff**: Automatic retry with increasing delays
- **Operation-Specific Retries**: Different retry strategies for read vs write operations
- **Configurable Limits**: Adjustable retry counts and delays
- **Smart Error Filtering**: Only retry on recoverable errors

### Connection Recovery

- **Automatic Reconnection**: Reconnects to SurrealDB on connection failures
- **Re-authentication**: Automatically re-authenticates after reconnection
- **Connection Validation**: Verifies connection health before retrying operations

### Enhanced Error Reporting

When `Continue on Fail` is enabled, errors include detailed information:
```json
{
  "error": {
    "message": "Connection timeout",
    "category": "TIMEOUT_ERROR",
    "severity": "MEDIUM",
    "retryable": true,
    "context": {
      "operation": "executeQuery",
      "itemIndex": 0,
      "timestamp": "2024-01-15T10:30:00Z",
      "recoveryStrategy": "CONNECTION_RECOVERY"
    }
  }
}
```

### Error Handling Strategies

Different operation types use different error handling strategies:

- **Read Operations**: Faster retries, continue on low/medium errors
- **Write Operations**: More retries, stop on medium+ errors
- **Critical Operations**: Minimal retries, stop on any error
- **Bulk Operations**: Moderate retries, handle rate limiting

For detailed information about the error handling system, see [Error Handling Documentation](docs/ERROR_HANDLING.md).
